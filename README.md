# Belly-Button-Dashboard
## Purpose
This dashboard visualizes bacterial data for each volunteer in different formats and provides us with demographic information for the research participant. The top 10 bacterial species found in each participant's belly button is displayed to help a company pick a candidate that has a specific species of bacteria. This dashboard includes a bar chart, bubble graph, and a gauge that measures the frequency of a variable.
